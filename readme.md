# go-ws

A toy/minimal WebSocket protocol implementation in Go.

`go-ws` is a lightweight WebSocket implementation that demonstrates real-time bidirectional communication between a Go server and web clients. The project includes both a WebSocket server written in Go and a minimalist HTML/JavaScript client.

I created this project because I've wanted to learn more about websockets, and everything I found was using gorilla/websocket, which abstracts a lot of the low-level details of the WebSocket protocol. https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6455 was my best friend on this project!

## How to run it

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NicolasLopes7/go-ws.git
cd go-ws
make run
```
